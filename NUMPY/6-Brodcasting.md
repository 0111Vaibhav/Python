Great topic! Let's break down Broadcasting and Vectorization in NumPy — both are powerful concepts that help write fast and memory-efficient code, but they’re different in purpose and behavior.

🔁 Broadcasting in NumPy
✅ What Is It?
Broadcasting is NumPy’s rule for performing operations on arrays of different shapes without explicitly replicating data.

It stretches smaller arrays to match the shape of larger ones during operations, without copying data.

📌 Example:
python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])         # shape (3,)
b = np.array([[10], [20]])      # shape (2,1)

result = a + b
print(result)
Output:

lua
Copy
Edit
[[11 12 13]
 [21 22 23]]
Here:

a → shape (3,) → broadcast to (2,3)

b → shape (2,1) → broadcast to (2,3)

⚡ Vectorization in NumPy
✅ What Is It?
Vectorization refers to rewriting loops using array operations — so the code runs much faster using low-level C implementations.

It eliminates for loops and allows batch operations.

📌 Example:
python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Vectorized operation
result = a + b
print(result)  # [5 7 9]
Instead of writing:

python
Copy
Edit
result = []
for i in range(len(a)):
    result.append(a[i] + b[i])
📊 Key Differences: Broadcasting vs Vectorization
Feature	Broadcasting	Vectorization
Purpose	Enables operations on arrays of different shapes	Speeds up code by using array operations
Changes shape?	✅ Yes – reshapes smaller arrays implicitly	❌ No – works on arrays of same shape
Requires loop?	❌ No – NumPy handles it automatically	❌ Replaces explicit loops
Memory efficient?	✅ Yes – avoids copying when expanding arrays	✅ Yes – uses optimized backend
Example	a + b (with different shapes)	a + b (with same shape instead of loop)

✅ Summary:
Broadcasting handles operations across arrays of different shapes.

Vectorization replaces explicit loops with fast, array-based computations.

Bonus Tip:
Broadcasting is often used inside vectorized operations — they work hand-in-hand.
